# Improvement Proposals

## IP-001: Secure Pairing Protocol
**Problem:** Passing `AGENT_TOKEN` manually is insecure and cumbersome.
**Solution:** Implement a Diffie-Hellman key exchange or a QR-code based pairing where the mobile app scans a code generated by the Operator on HDMI out to establish the initial secret.

## IP-002: Semantic Policy Enforcement
**Problem:** Regex allowlists are fragile.
**Solution:** Use a lightweight local NLP model (e.g., DistilBERT or a quantized LLM on the edge) to classify command intent as "Safe" or "Destructive" before execution.

## IP-003: Session Resumption
**Problem:** If the browser tab closes, the agent forgets its goal.
**Solution:** Persist the `action_history` and `goal` in the `rng_operator` (backend) state, so the frontend can reconnect and resume the session.

## IP-004: Offline VLM Fallback
**Problem:** No internet = No reasoning.
**Solution:** Deploy a 4-bit quantized VLM (e.g., Moondream or PaliGemma) on the Android device (via MediaPipe/TFLite) to allow basic "Click OK" functionality without cloud connectivity.
